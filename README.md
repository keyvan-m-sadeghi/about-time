OK, so first of all, I've written this book for me, don't owe you a damn thing!
It's all gonna sound like cliches and bullshit you heard a million times before.
It won't be a timeless piece. I'll talk about specific events in my time on this earth. Timefull.
You shouldn't see this as a blueprint of anything, quote or adopt it in your work and life.
Fuck that shit! Draw your own conclusions.

# What's wrong with this world?

Nothing! I stand corrected, everything!

People kill each other. Greedy assheads rule. We struggle to put food on the table, worried that there won't be a table soon, eviction is coming if I don't pay this month's rent!

Yet, life is a deceptively beautiful son of a gun! Trees are green, babies make you laugh, sun will shine for the foreseeable future. Rockets are gonna take us to visit moon for a vacation! How fucking cool is that?
