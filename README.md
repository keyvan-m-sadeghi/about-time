# About Time
<th title was unity, thought thats what I wanna talk about>

OK, so first of all, I've written this book for me, don't owe you a damn thing!
It's all gonna sound like cliches and bullshit you heard a million times before.
It won't be a timeless piece. I'll talk about specific events in my time on this earth. Timefull.
You shouldn't see this as a blueprint of anything, quote or adopt it in your work and life.
Fuck that shit! Draw your own conclusions.

<proceeds to describe his life events and learnings>

# What's wrong with this world?

Nothing! I stand corrected, everything!

People kill each other. Greedy assheads rule. We struggle to put food on the table, worried that there won't be a table soon, eviction is coming if I don't make this month's rent!

Yet, life is a deceptively beautiful son of a gun! Trees are green, babies make you laugh, sun will shine for the foreseeable future. Rockets are gonna take us to visit moon for a vacation! How fucking cool is that?

I think this world is a scam. We need to crash and burn it and build a new one. In no possible world the likes of Trump, Biden and Elon Musk should be anywhere near power. They're all delusional! Two of them wouldn't know they've pissed themselves, debatable which two!

This book attempts to formulate a plan to reimagine the world, and reformat it in that image.

BTW, you don't need to read the whole thing, here's the algorithm in a few lines:
1. Challenge Authority
2. Empathize with everything in between until you meet the authority
3. Replace Authority with a modern system
4. Iterate!

If you're more mathematically minded:

```tex
life = meaning / time
```

# God does not exist!

Or does he? Or she? Or ze?! Anyhow, that fucking thing is the biggest scam of all. Ah also, anytime you felt like this has started to offend you, feel free to close whatever medium you're perceiving it from! There's extensive literature about this, so I'll just say, God is a quantum state IFF it exists. But so are we, the people, all. So fuck god.

# Singularity / Imam of time

Another futile pursuit. This has been prophesized in all cultures I happened upon. IT'S A BIG FUCKING LIE. We're in the constant state of singularity. There is no spoon!

# Artificial General Intelligence

Heh, you get the drill here? Well, this one probably isn't a scam. And I say "probably" only because we haven't made the damn thing yet. But we're about to. It won't give us superintelligence, not that the hypothesis is wrong, because the universe too is in a state of singularity, it generates problems in a faster rate.

# Life is meaning over time

This one screams it's a fact. It's my (current) 42: the answer to life, universe, and everything. I came up with it while taking a shit, I dunno, an hour ago? It takes different forms in my mind and regurgitates all over the place every day. Had me committed to a psychiatric hospital in 2011. It's definitely a better starting point than 42 :) but I won't surrender my 42 for anything. It's forever immortalized in my son's middle and last name!

# Are you watching closely?

This means that every movie you watched is a documentary. You weren't the only person in the world who watched that movie, right? So, amongst those who watched, there's definitely been people who empathized with at least one character throughout. Hence, that character has lived! Same for every book, cave carving, etc. By generalization, no original idea ever existed! The only given fact is the sun, and how it makes us dance to the song of uni/multiverse.

Okay, these were all my present authorities. Back to the linear world. I'll bring experimental data for the rest of this. Please if you're following along, verify or contradict.
