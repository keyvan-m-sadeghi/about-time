OK, so first of all, I've written this book for me, don't owe you a damn thing!
It's all gonna sound like cliches and bulshit you heard a million times before.
It won't be a timeless piece. I'll talk abot specific events in my time on this earth. It's timefull.
You shouldn't see this as a blueprint of anything, quote and reference it in your work and life.
Fuck that shit! Draw your own conclusions.
