# About Time
<th title was unity, thought thats what I wanna talk about>

OK, so first of all, I've written this book for me, don't owe you a damn thing!
It's all gonna sound like cliches and bullshit you heard a million times before.
It won't be a timeless piece. I'll talk about specific events in my time on this earth. Timefull.
You shouldn't see this as a blueprint of anything, quote or adopt it in your work and life.
Fuck that shit! Draw your own conclusions.

# What's wrong with this world?

Nothing! I stand corrected, everything!

People kill each other. Greedy assheads rule. We struggle to put food on the table, worried that there won't be a table soon, eviction is coming if I don't pay this month's rent!

Yet, life is a deceptively beautiful son of a gun! Trees are green, babies make you laugh, sun will shine for the foreseeable future. Rockets are gonna take us to visit moon for a vacation! How fucking cool is that?

I think this world is a scam. We need to crash and burn it and build a new one. In no possible world the likes of Trump, Biden and Elon Musk should be anywhere near power. They're all delusional! Two of them wouldn't know they've pissed themselves, debatable which two!

This book attempts to formulate a plan to reimagine the world, and reformat it in that image!

BTW, you don't need to read the whole thing, here's the algorithm in a few lines:
1. Challenge Authority
2. Empathize with everything and everything until you meet the authority
3. Replace Authority with a modern system
